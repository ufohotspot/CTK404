    <li>In this image, it shows a advertisement of the brookfield zoo. The ad appears to be from the 60s-70s timeframe and features a image of a fierce black panther. The ad is very simplistic and easy to grasp and the drawing of the panther is nicely done. Although it's very cartoonish, the art matchs the description of real panther down by the color to the eyes and teeth. The art piece was drawn by a group called Federal Art Project.</li>
